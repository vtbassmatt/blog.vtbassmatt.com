Summary: Another basic data structure and a strong beer.
Status: draft

Usually when you learn about stacks, you also learn queues. Computer Science and Beer won't break with that tradition. The beer that called my name from the shelf today is [Lagunitas](https://lagunitas.com)'s [Undercover Investigation Shut-down](https://lagunitas.com/beers/undercover-investigation-shut-down/), an American strong ale weighing in at 9.75%(!). The BJCP would probably call this a 19C American Barleywine.
