Summary: How we got here and what we drank.

Today I find myself enjoying a [Legend Brewing Company](http://www.legendbrewing.com) Brown Ale on the dock at my mother in law's home. She lives at Lake Anna, Virginia, right on the water. Even though I love the Pacific Northwest, it's always relaxing to come down to the lake and sip a beer by the water.

Since I do live in the Pacific Northwest and my mother in law in central Virginia, I had to travel here somehow. The distance is great enough that flying is the only viable option (though someday I hope to take the train &mdash; with the right tickets, I could get to Culpeper, Virginia, which is only a short drive away). Taking a flight always reminds me of the data structure we call a graph, so that's what we'll cover in today's Computer Science + Beer.

Appearance
----------

Confession: I didn't drink this one out of a glass. Burn the heretic, I hear you cry. Well, that's the way it is when you're on vacation at the lake. I presume this would be a pretty standard-looking brown ale: Brown beer, light colored head, fairly clear.

We can [examine the label](http://legendbrewing.com/ourbeers.asp?category=1&hc1=2), though, and I'll admit that it's off-putting to me. We have a unicorn rearing up in front of a red heraldic field surrounded by barley and hops: Quite Arthurian. I'm sure it's quite meaningful to the brewer and designer so I don't want to disparage, but it doesn't exactly scream "excellent beer" from the shelf.

Aroma
-----

In keeping with my confession above, take this with a grain of salt. I'm huffing through the mouth-scented rim of a bottle (you're welcome for that mental image). Despite adverse conditions, I get a lovely toffee note with little hop aroma. Nothing off (from the beer). There's a bit of a grainy note that's not unpleasant, and this is definitely going to be a sweet beer.

Flavor and Mouthfeel
--------------------

The toffee and grainy aromas I detected continued into the flavor. The brewer says molasses on their site, which I probably wouldn't have come up with on my own but it's not an unfair description. It's not as cloying as I feared, though definitely malty-sweet. It seems highly carbonated to me, which probably helps cut the sweetness. I also get a light hop bitterness (no particular flavor) on the tongue. Quite full-bodied &mdash; perhaps not the wisest beer choice on a 90 degree day, but I'm enjoying it nonetheless! Finishes sweet and sticky, a low point for me as I like my beers to finish fairly clean.

Overall Impression
------------------

The beer's easily a 4.5/5 for me. I've passed this up in the grocery store numerous times on previous trips because I tend toward the aggressively-bittered styles, but it's a mistake I won't repeat. Despite the label, the beer is great and I'm excited to finish the six-pack. And that's not just the sun talking.
