Summary: How we got here and what we drank.

Today I find myself enjoying a [Legend Brewing Company](http://www.legendbrewing.com) Brown Ale on the dock at my mother in law's home. She lives at Lake Anna, Virginia, right on the water. Even though I love the Pacific Northwest, it's always relaxing to come down to the lake and sip a beer by the water.

Since I do live in the Pacific Northwest and my mother in law in central Virginia, I had to travel here somehow. The distance is great enough that flying is the only viable option (though someday I hope to take the train &mdash; with the right tickets, I could get to Culpeper, Virginia, which is only a short drive away). Taking a flight always reminds me of the data structure we call a graph, so that's what we'll cover in today's Computer Science + Beer.
